I'm Rafael, a dedicated web developer specializing in back-end and full-stack development. With a strong background in collecting extensive data through web scraping and crafting data parsing tools, I'm passionate about transforming raw information into actionable insights.

My journey in web development has been a dynamic blend of challenges and accomplishments. In my previous position, I went from building and maintaining React/Node.js front-end applications to architecting Python service back-ends for distributed web scrapers spanning over 40 utilities across the USA, I've left no stone unturned. I've also contributed to a Ruby on Rails monolith, which served as an API, portal, and data consumer for web scrapers and more. My expertise lies in weaving together diverse technologies to create cohesive solutions.

Looking for a seasoned developer to elevate your projects? Your search ends here. I offer my wealth of experience to assist you in achieving your goals. Whether it's optimizing data collection, refining data quality, or building user-friendly interfaces, I'm here to empower you with technology that drives results.

My commitment extends beyond code. I'm driven by a passion for data quality, clear and transparent communication, and the empowerment of individuals and organizations through data. I believe in making data accessible, transparent, and ultimately, useful. 

My mission is simple yet profound: to make the world a little bit better through technology. I envision a future where data is not just abundant but also reliable, where decisions are informed, and where accessibility to information fosters positive change. Together, let's take steps towards this vision.
